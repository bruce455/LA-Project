This is not a huge detriment since applications often only require an approximation of the largest eigenvalue.  Also, as we will demonstrate below, it is possible to easily modify the method to approximate the other eigenvalues.  A more significant disadvantage is that the rate at which the sequence converges can be slow in some circumstances.  For example, we can see that if $|\\lambda_1|$ is close to $|\\lambda_2|$, then $|\\lambda_1/\\lambda_2|^m$ approaches zero more slowly as $m$ gets large.

This means that we solve one $n\\times n$ system for every iteration.  This appears to require more work than the construction of $A^{-1}$, but in fact it is less since every system involves the same coefficient matrix.  We can therefore save much work by performing elimination only once and storing the result in an $LU$ factorization.

    "Using a small modification to the Inverse Power Method, we can also approximate eigenvalues that are not the smallest.  For this variation of the method, we need to observe that if we \"shift\" the diagonal entries of a matrix by a scalar $\\mu$, all of the eigenvalues of the matrix are also shifted by $\\mu$.  Let $A$ be an $n\\times n$ matrix with eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and corresponding eigenvector $V$, so that $AV=\\lambda V$.  Then $(A-\\mu I)V = AV - \\mu V = \\lambda V - \\mu V = (\\lambda-\\mu)V$, which means that $V$ is also an eigenvector of the matrix $(A-\\mu I)$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda -\\mu$.  \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful because it allows us to now use the Inverse Power Method to approximate the eigenvalue of $A$ that lies closest to $\\mu$.  For example, if $\\mu$ is closest to $\\lambda_2$, then $|\\lambda_2-\\mu| < |\\lambda_i -\\mu|$ for all other $i\\neq 2$, which means that $(\\lambda_2-\\mu)$ can be approximated by applying the Inverse Power Method to $(A-\\mu I)$."

Note that once we have a good approximation to the eigenvector with $X^{(m)}$, we can approximate the eigenvalue of $A$ with $||AX^{(m)}||$."
